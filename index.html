    <h1>welcome!</h1>
    <h2>my name's michael</h2>
    <p>and I use he/they pronouns. Here you'll find some information about me, my interests, books I've read, and
      other miscellaneous things. This is your one-stop shop to know all about me! </p>
    <h2>interests</h2>
    <h3>games</h3>
    <p>Pokemon is a big special interest with Black being one of the first games I played. Emerald is also one of my
      favorite games, but my focus has shifted to competitive battling like on <a class="ignore_link_css"
        href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokemon Showdown</a>.
      TF2 is also a pretty big interest for me. I've played it for over 7 years now, mostly playing spy.
      Some other games I play a lot include:
    <ul>
      <li>Stellaris</li>
      <li>Civilization VI</li>
      <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and 3</li>
      <li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>books</h3>
    <p>I'm mostly into science fiction novels, my favorite ones being the Dune series (I've only read the first two
      novels
      so far), and Brave New World. Some other books I've read include The Three Musketeers, Ready Player One and
      Armada.
    </p>
    <h3>coding</h3>
    <p>I'm still learning how to code, mostly knowing C, Python, SQL, and now web development thanks to Harvard's
      CS50. Although
      I'm not completely finished with the course, I can grasp concepts pretty quickly.</p>
