        <h1>hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first projects-post here. Currently, I'm not too sure about what to post here, but hopefully my brain
            will
            find some ideas. I'm actually still making this site as I'm writing this, only really happy with the home
            page.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which, the home page is a result of numerous <s>stolen ideas</s> inspirations. When I first
            started designing my
            site, I had a vague idea of its shape and layout. Actually piecing together all of the components was
            difficult.
            Most of my time was spent looking at other peoples' sites to get inspiration. Granted, some of that time
            was
            spent on procrastinating building this site rather than actually building it.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I can see the
            direction I want to take this site in, and hopefully you'll be able to see its end-result!</p>
